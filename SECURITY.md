# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are only provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | ❌: No             |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly!

**Please do NOT report security issues publicly via GitHub Issues.**  
Instead, use one of the following private channels (the first one is strongly preferred):

1. **Preferred method** – Open a private vulnerability report directly on GitHub:  
   https://github.com/B4rtekk1/Skysync/security/advisories/new  
   GitHub will automatically notify maintainers and keep details hidden from the public.

2. Send an email to: `bartoszkasyna@gmail.com`  

3. As a last resort, send a direct message on GitHub or Discord '@bartekbk1'.

### What to expect
- Acknowledgment of receipt within **48 hours**.
- Initial triage within **7 days**.
- For accepted vulnerabilities: a fix in the next patch/minor release (critical issues usually ≤ 14 days).
- Publication of a GitHub Security Advisory with credit to you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Disclosure Policy
- We follow coordinated disclosure.
- Once the fix is released, a public GitHub Security Advisory will be created (you’ll be credited by name or pseudonym).
- We’ll keep you updated throughout the entire process.

## Scope
This policy applies only to code maintained in this repository and official releases.

Out-of-scope items include:
- Denial-of-service attacks against running instances.
- Security issues caused by misconfiguration in production.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that do not yet have a public CVE (these are handled automatically by Dependabot).

## Bug Bounty
We currently do not offer a monetary bug-bounty program, but we are extremely grateful for responsible disclosures. Top reporters will be listed in our **Hall of Fame** (in README or a dedicated CONTRIBUTORS.md file) and receive eternal gratitude (and virtual pizza 🍕).

Thank you for helping keep the project and its users safe! ❤️
